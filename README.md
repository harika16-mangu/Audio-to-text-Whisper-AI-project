# Whisper AI Transcription & Translation Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **OpenAI Whisper**, a state-of-the-art speech recognition system, to **transcribe audio files** and **translate them into multiple languages**.  
The primary goal was to explore Whisper’s capabilities in handling multilingual speech data and evaluate its performance in transcription and translation tasks.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎙️ **Speech-to-Text**: Converts spoken audio into text with high accuracy.  
- 🌍 **Multilingual Translation**: Translates transcribed text into multiple target languages.  
- 🛠️ **Easy Integration**: Implemented in Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and reproducibility.  
- 📊 **Evaluation**: Tested on sample audio inputs to verify transcription quality and translation accuracy.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways
- Whisper provides **highly accurate transcription** even with noisy or accented speech.  
- The model supports **multilingual input and output**, making it valuable for real-world applications like customer support, accessibility tools, and global communication.  
- Using Whisper in Jupyter Notebook makes it easy to **prototype and test use cases** before moving to production environments.  
- This project can serve as a **foundation** for more advanced applications such as automated meeting transcriptions, subtitles generation, and AI-powered translators.

## 🎉 Fun Fact
The audio I used in this project is extra special 💖 — it’s the introduction I recorded when I received my first-ever interview call from Johnson & Johnson during my first semester of the Data Analytics Engineering master’s program at Northeastern University.
I stumbled upon this old recording while looking through past videos, and it felt meaningful to use it here — making this project personally memorable.
